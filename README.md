# Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data

This project is a coding challenge presented by Codecademy, exploring the use of Deep Learning in regression tasks. The goal is to build a regression model to predict the likelihood of a student's acceptance into graduate school based on application factors such as test scores.

## Features

- Built a deep learning regression model.  
- Utilized **Callbacks** to optimize training.  
- Incorporated **TensorBoard** for monitoring and visualizing progress.  
- Performed **Hyperparameter Tuning** to enhance model performance.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- TensorBoard  
- Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing
